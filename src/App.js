  // multitude of competitions and performances (for band, philharmonic, 
  // honor band, and a musical), I developed an understanding of music 
  // performance, music theory, and sound composition. While attending the 
  // University of Nevada, Las Vegas, my study of computer science and 
  // mathematics and how they relate to video games allowed me to develop 
  // strategies for problem analysis, problem solving, information structuring, 
  // and understanding information relativity. The one thing that remained 
  // consistent through most of my upbringing was my love and enjoyment of 
  // video games and how video games helped me do better for myself. Video 
  // games gave me some of the best friendships I could ever ask for, 
  // challenged me to improve myself and my understanding of things, and taught 
  // me how to work together with others to overcome a shared obstacle. When I 
  // dropped out of college, my love for video games drove me to develop a 
  // passion I could believe in that kept me going. Through that passion, I 
  // developed understandings and skills in product/service composition, design, 
  // custom asset development (and the various tools used to build them), project 
  // management, and communication.`

  `I was born and raised in Las Vegas, Nevada. My early interest in acting led me 
  to study memorization, posing, dialogue, and expression techniques. Later, as a 
  musician, I participated in various competitions and performances, including band, 
  philharmonic, honor band, and a musical. This experience helped me develop a deep 
  understanding of music performance, music theory, and sound composition. While 
  attending the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, I studied computer science and 
  mathematics, focusing on how they relate to video games. This academic background 
  allowed me to develop skills in problem analysis, problem-solving, information 
  structuring, and understanding information relativity. Throughout my life, video 
  games have been a consistent source of joy and inspiration. They have provided me 
  with some of the best friendships I could ever ask for, challenged me to improve 
  myself, and taught me the importance of teamwork in overcoming shared obstacles. 
  After leaving college, my passion for video games drove me to pursue a career in the 
  industry. This passion fueled my growth and led me to develop valuable skills in 
  product and service composition, design, custom asset development, project management, 
  and communication. Through these experiences, I found a purpose that motivates me
